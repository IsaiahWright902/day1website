  <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a pretty average kid, I love video games and anime, I love working hard to reach a goal, and I love to meet
    new people. Ive always done well at subjects im interested in witch I thin is why codeworks is perfect for me. I
    compared the costs of collage to the costs of CodeWorks program and realized that I would most likely be better of
    going to CodeWorks. I belive that coding is the future and slowly other jobs will be sucked up by people that can
    code because of how much more efficanly a computer can do things than a human being. I also think learning to build
    applications and software is important because everything today is moving twoards being ran of a computer. They even
    have refrigerators now that you can play pandora off. I am very greatfull for my opportunity to go to CodeWroks and
    cant wait to see my future hard work pay off.</p>
